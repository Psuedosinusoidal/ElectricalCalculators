# [WIP] CircuitSolver CMD
Developed by: PseudoSinusoidal

## Overview
CircuitSolver is still being developed and a long way from done so updates may be infrequent and bugfixes are common.\
If you do find any bugs please report them and we'll get them fixed right away! All suggestions are very welcome and will help out in development a lot!

Currently all you need to run CircuitSolver is to have Python 3 installed on your system.

CircuitSolver has 2 branches the [CMD Branch](https://github.com/PseudoSinusoidal/CircuitSolver/tree/cmd) and the [GUI Branch](https://github.com/PseudoSinusoidal/CircuitSolver/tree/gui) each one can be use independently depending on what you would like to do. If you would like to run it in a terminal use the [CMD Branch](https://github.com/PseudoSinusoidal/CircuitSolver/tree/cmd), if you like to run it in a desktop environment use the [GUI Branch](https://github.com/PseudoSinusoidal/CircuitSolver/tree/gui). Each has their own weaknesses and advantages.

### Current Modules Available

- [ ] Compiled Executable for [GUI Branch](https://github.com/PseudoSinusoidal/CircuitSolver/tree/gui)
- [ ] Resistor Module: Current divider
- [ ] 555 Timer Module: Component to Frequency

## How to Use (The Terminal Way)
To use CircuitSolver GUI find a suitable version in the [versions](https://github.com/PseudoSinusoidal/CircuitSolver/tree/cmd) tab, then download the .zip file and extract the contents into an easily accessible location, next open a familiar terminal program, cd into/locate the main.py file, finally run the below command.\
```
python3 main.py
```
