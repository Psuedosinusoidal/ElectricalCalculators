# CircuitSolver
Developed by: PseudoSinusoidal\
Co-Developed by: Floppy :P

## Overview
CircuitSolver is still being developed and is a long way from done so updates may be infrequent and bugfixes are common.\
If you do find any bugs please report them and we'll get them fixed right away! Any suggestions are very welcome and will help out a lot in development!

Currently the only dependencies for CircuitSolver is Python 3.

### Branches
CircuitSolver has 2 branches the [CMD Branch](https://github.com/PseudoSinusoidal/CircuitSolver/tree/cmd) and the [GUI Branch](https://github.com/PseudoSinusoidal/CircuitSolver/tree/gui) each one can be use independently depending on what you would like to do. If you would like to run it in a terminal use the [CMD Branch](https://github.com/PseudoSinusoidal/CircuitSolver/tree/cmd), if you like to run it in a desktop environment use the [GUI Branch](https://github.com/PseudoSinusoidal/CircuitSolver/tree/gui). Each has their own weaknesses and advantages.

### Current Modules Available
- 555 Timer
  - Frequency to Component
  - Component to Frequency
- Ohm's Law
  - (General Calculations)
- Resistors
  - Color Code Lookup
  - Voltage Divider
 
### Next Updates

- [x] 555 Timer Module: Component to Frequency

## How to Use
### The Terminal Way
To use CircuitSolver "The Terminal Way" find a suitable version in the [releases](https://github.com/PseudoSinusoidal/CircuitSolver/tree/cmd) tab, then download the .zip file and extract the contents into an easily accessible location, next open a familiar terminal program, cd into/locate the main.py file, finally run the below command!
```
python3 main.py
```

### The Executable Way
[WIP] To use CircuitSolver "The Executable Way" find a suitable executable version in the [releases](https://github.com/PseudoSinusoidal/CircuitSolver/tree/cmd) tab, then download the file and run the executable.\
That's it!
