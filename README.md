Updates may be infrequent.

Currently the only dependency is that you have python installed. In console, type 'python main.py' to launch program, or open directly.

Current modules:
- Ohm's Law (General calculations)
- 555 Timer (Helpful tools for Monostable and Astable)
- Resistance (Color Code Lookup and Voltage Divider equations)

This is a work in progress and has a large roadmap. Please give suggestions and report bugs.

Next updates:
- 555 Calculator: Astable (Components to Frequency mode)
- Adding scientific notations to help readability
- GUI Branch
- Compiled executable for cmd branch
- Resistor module: Current divider
